    "## Conclusion\n",
    "* So as we can see, there are three logs that are different from the rest of the logs.\n",
    "* Since the minimum number of logs needed to form a cluster is 2, the three logs are either clustered with all the logs (1 cluster of 50 logs) or none of them are clustered together (all labelled as noise)\n",
    "* Overall, it shows that the one dimension encoding is not able to capture the seperation between the logs.\n",
    "* If we run testing on this current state, there will be two cases.\n",
    "    * First, if we keep the original hardcoded hyperparameters, i.e., eps=0.3, min samples=3, we will get everything as noise and all the test cases will be predicted as noise. It would default to 0 which means it is not a flake. We have around 30% flakes in our dataset implying the accuracy of this model would be 70%. However, f1-score for the flake class would be 0. \n",
    "    * Second, if we modify the hyperparameters, everything will be one cluster. Since most points in this cluster will not be flakes, the cluster would be defined as non flakes. Again we get ~70% accuracy and 0 f1-score for flake class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* In essence, the current method works well for very simple log messages but we will need to apply our data science workflow (EDA, research, POC) for real and complex logs. "
